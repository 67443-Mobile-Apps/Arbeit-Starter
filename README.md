67-443: Arbeit (Firebase)
---
This is just a simple task management app using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store data and handle authentication. There is much more to Firebase and an abundance of documentation and help from Google (and others).  This may not be the right solution for all applications, but it works well for many apps and definitely worth considering for projects.

This is a code-completion exercise, where students will have to either change some code or complete the missing code for the app to work as demostrated in class.

Some key things we will need to do in this exercise:

- Change the bundle identifier
- Set up Keychain entitlment to use the revised bundle
- Set up Firebase database and get plist
- Manually enter some data _(depending on time)_
- Install Firebase with either Cocoapods or SPM
- Set up Firebase connection in delegate
- Update the `Task` model with failable `init`
- Set up references in `TaskViewController`
- Complete method for populating task list _(see comments)_
